## Hardware
* Just this inexpensive kit: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CXVA6IO
* Added this individually addressable LED Strip https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MG49QKD


## Assembly / Wiring
* Since I dont have a CD drive, I didnt even look at the CD.  But I found [these](./robot-car-instructions.pdf) instructions online
* Couple of pointers on the instructions:
  * I removed the brown paper from the plexiglass base
  * Battery didnt fit as described in instructions, I used double sided tape
  * Similiarly with the servo mount, I used double sided tape to just stick it on and not the included screws
  * Wiring instructions were good
  * I added the LED Strip and plugged it into A0 Pin slot with the extra 2 wired into the battery pack
  * If robot keeps reverting to setup method, it is likely just power, make sure battery pack is switched on and charged
